Pyscores: Football scores and data in your terminal 
===================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/conormag94/pyscores.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/conormag94/pyscores)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyscores.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyscores)

**Pyscores is a command line based python program to get football fixtures, results and standings.**

This is a work in progress. It was inspired by another trending repo I saw on github. I wanted to see if I could do my own implementation of it, as a learning exercise.

**Tested in Python 2.7 and >=3.3**

## Setup
**To use this you will need an api key from api.football-data.org. Without this the program will still work but will be limited to 50 requests per day.**

Once you have your key, you must set an environment variable called `PYSCORES_KEY` so the program can use it.

**To install (with pip):** 
```
pip install pyscores
```

**To Verify installation:**
```
scores --help
```

## Usage

**Recent results**
```
scores results --league=PL
```
```
scores results -l PL
```
where ` PL ` is the league code for the Premier League

**Fixtures for next matchday**
```
scores fixtures --league=PL
```
```
scores fixtures -l PL
```

**Specifying number of days for Fixtures or Results**
```
scores results --league=PL --days=20
```
```
scores results -l PL -d 20
```
The days argument is optional and will default to 7 if not specified.

**League standings**
```
scores standings --league=PL
```
```
scores standings -l PL
```
